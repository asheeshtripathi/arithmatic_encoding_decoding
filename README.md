There are two approaches to arithmetic source coding and decoding. The static encoding and technique use pre-calculated
probabilities of the symbols for encoding and decoding. The dynamic encoding and decoding technique uses uniform probability 
distribution initially and updates cumulative probabilities as encoding and decoding is done.
MATLAB files static_arith.m encodes and decodes statically, and dyna_arith.m encodes and decodes dynamically.
